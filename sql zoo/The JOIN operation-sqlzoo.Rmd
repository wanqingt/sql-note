```


13. CASE WHEN = if 
Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.\

```{sql connection=}


SELECT mdate, 
  team1, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS score1, 
      team2, 
         SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score2
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;
```
